<p>Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
Intervals like [1,2] and [2,3] have borders "touching" but they don't overlap each other.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: [ [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,3] ]</p>

<p>Output: 1</p>

<p>Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input: [ [1,2], [1,2], [1,2] ]</p>

<p>Output: 2</p>

<p>Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals non-overlapping.</p>

<p>Example 3:</p>

<p>Input: [ [1,2], [2,3] ]</p>

<p>Output: 0</p>

<p>Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.</p>
