<p>Suppose you have N integers from 1 to N. We define a beautiful arrangement as an array that is constructed by these N numbers successfully if one of the following is true for the ith position (1 
The number at the ith position is divisible by i.
i is divisible by the number at the ith position.</p>

<p>Now given N, how many beautiful arrangements can you construct?</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The first beautiful arrangement is [1, 2]:
Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 1, and 1 is divisible by i (i=1).
Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=2).
The second beautiful arrangement is [2, 1]:
Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=1).
Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 1, and i (i=2) is divisible by 1.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>N is a positive integer and will not exceed 15.</p>
