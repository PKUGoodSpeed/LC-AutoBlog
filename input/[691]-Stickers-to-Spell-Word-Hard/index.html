<ul>
<li>algorithms</li>
<li>Hard (34.96%)</li>
<li>Total Accepted:    4.4K</li>
<li>Total Submissions: 12.5K</li>
<li>Testcase Example:  '["with","example","science"]\n"thehat"'</li>
</ul>

<p>We are given N different types of stickers.  Each sticker has a lowercase English word on it.</p>

<p>You would like to spell out the given target string by cutting individual letters from your collection of stickers and rearranging them.</p>

<p>You can use each sticker more than once if you want, and you have infinite quantities of each sticker.</p>

<p>What is the minimum number of stickers that you need to spell out the target?  If the task is impossible, return -1.</p>

<p>Example 1:
Input:
["with", "example", "science"], "thehat"</p>

<p>Output:
3</p>

<p>Explanation:
We can use 2 "with" stickers, and 1 "example" sticker.
After cutting and rearrange the letters of those stickers, we can form the target "thehat".
Also, this is the minimum number of stickers necessary to form the target string.</p>

<p>Example 2:
Input:
["notice", "possible"], "basicbasic"</p>

<p>Output:
-1</p>

<p>Explanation:
We can't form the target "basicbasic" from cutting letters from the given stickers.</p>

<p>Note:
stickers has length in the range [1, 50].
stickers consists of lowercase English words (without apostrophes).
target has length in the range [1, 15], and consists of lowercase English letters.
In all test cases, all words were chosen randomly from the 1000 most common US English words, and the target was chosen as a concatenation of two random words.
The time limit may be more challenging than usual.  It is expected that a 50 sticker test case can be solved within 35ms on average.</p>
