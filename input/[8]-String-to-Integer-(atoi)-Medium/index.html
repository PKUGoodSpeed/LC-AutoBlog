<p>Implement atoi which converts a string to an integer.</p>

<p>The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.</p>

<p>The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.</p>

<p>If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.</p>

<p>If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<pre><code>Only the space character ' ' is considered as whitespace character.
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. If the numerical value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (231 − 1) or INT_MIN (−231) is returned.
</code></pre>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: "42"
Output: 42</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input: "   -42"
Output: -42
Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is '-', which is the minus sign.
             Then take as many numerical digits as possible, which gets 42.</p>

<p>Example 3:</p>

<p>Input: "4193 with words"
Output: 4193
Explanation: Conversion stops at digit '3' as the next character is not a numerical digit.</p>

<p>Example 4:</p>

<p>Input: "words and 987"
Output: 0
Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is 'w', which is not a numerical 
             digit or a +/- sign. Therefore no valid conversion could be performed.</p>

<p>Example 5:</p>

<p>Input: "-91283472332"
Output: -2147483648
Explanation: The number "-91283472332" is out of the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
             Thefore INT_MIN (−231) is returned.</p>
