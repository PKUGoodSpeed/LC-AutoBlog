<p>Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.</p>

<p>Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.</p>

<p>The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Given nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3,</p>

<p>Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Given nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2,</p>

<p>Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 1, 3, 0, and 4.</p>

<p>Note that the order of those five elements can be arbitrary.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.</p>

<p>Clarification:</p>

<p>Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?</p>

<p>Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.</p>

<p>Internally you can think of this:</p>

<p>// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeElement(nums, val);</p>

<p>// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}</p>
