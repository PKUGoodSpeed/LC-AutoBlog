<p>Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input:
"tree"</p>

<p>Output:
"eert"</p>

<p>Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input:
"cccaaa"</p>

<p>Output:
"cccaaa"</p>

<p>Explanation:
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.</p>

<p>Example 3:</p>

<p>Input:
"Aabb"</p>

<p>Output:
"bbAa"</p>

<p>Explanation:
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.</p>
