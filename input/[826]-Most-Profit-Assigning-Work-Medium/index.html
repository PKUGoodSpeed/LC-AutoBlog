</ul>

<p>We have jobs: difficulty[i] is the difficulty of the ith job, and profit[i] is the profit of the ith job. </p>

<p>Now we have some workers. worker[i] is the ability of the ith worker, which means that this worker can only complete a job with difficulty at most worker[i]. </p>

<p>Every worker can be assigned at most one job, but one job can be completed multiple times.</p>

<p>For example, if 3 people attempt the same job that pays $1, then the total profit will be $3.  If a worker cannot complete any job, his profit is $0.</p>

<p>What is the most profit we can make?</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: difficulty = [2,4,6,8,10], profit = [10,20,30,40,50], worker = [4,5,6,7]
Output: 100 
Explanation: Workers are assigned jobs of difficulty [4,4,6,6] and they get profit of [20,20,30,30] seperately.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<pre><code>1 &lt;= difficulty.length = profit.length &lt;= 10000
1 &lt;= worker.length &lt;= 10000
difficulty[i], profit[i], worker[i]  are in range [1, 10^5]
</code></pre>
