<p>Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors.</p>

<p>OJ's undirected graph serialization:</p>

<p>Nodes are labeled uniquely.</p>

<p>We use # as a separator for each node, and , as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.</p>

<p>As an example, consider the serialized graph {0,1,2#1,2#2,2}.</p>

<p>The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by #.</p>

<p>First node is labeled as 0. Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2.
Second node is labeled as 1. Connect node 1 to node 2.
Third node is labeled as 2. Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.</p>

<p>Visually, the graph looks like the following:</p>

<pre><code>   1
  / \
 /   \
0 --- 2
     / \
     \_/
</code></pre>
