<p>Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.</p>

<p>Example:
For num = 5 you should return [0,1,1,2,1,2].</p>

<p>Follow up:</p>

<p>It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n*sizeof(integer)). But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a single pass?
Space complexity should be O(n).
Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like <em>_builtin</em>popcount  in c++ or in any other language.</p>
