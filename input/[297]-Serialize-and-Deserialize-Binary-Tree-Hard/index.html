<p>Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.</p>

<p>Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.</p>

<p>Example: </p>

<p>You may serialize the following tree:</p>

<pre><code>1
</code></pre>

<p>/ \
  2   3
     / \
    4   5</p>

<p>as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"</p>

<p>Clarification: The above format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.</p>

<p>Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.</p>
