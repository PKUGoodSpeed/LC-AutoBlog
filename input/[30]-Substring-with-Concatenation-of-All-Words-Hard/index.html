<li>Testcase Example:  '"barfoothefoobarman"\n["foo","bar"]'</li>
</ul>

<p>You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input:
  s = "barfoothefoobarman",
  words = ["foo","bar"]
Output: [0,9]
Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoor" and "foobar" respectively.
The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input:
  s = "wordgoodstudentgoodword",
  words = ["word","student"]
Output: []</p>
