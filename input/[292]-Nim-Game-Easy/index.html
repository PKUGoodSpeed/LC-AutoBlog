<p>You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend: There is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones. The one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will take the first turn to remove the stones.</p>

<p>Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game. Write a function to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>Input: 4
Output: false 
Explanation: If there are 4 stones in the heap, then you will never win the game;
             No matter 1, 2, or 3 stones you remove, the last stone will always be 
             removed by your friend.</p>
