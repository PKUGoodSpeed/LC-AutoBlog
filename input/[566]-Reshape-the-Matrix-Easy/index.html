<p>In MATLAB, there is a very useful function called 'reshape', which can reshape a matrix into a new one with different size but keep its original data.</p>

<p>You're given a matrix represented by a two-dimensional array, and two positive integers r and c representing the row number and column number of the wanted reshaped matrix, respectively.</p>

<p>The reshaped matrix need to be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.</p>

<p>If the 'reshape' operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: 
nums = 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
r = 1, c = 4
Output: 
[[1,2,3,4]]
Explanation:The row-traversing of nums is [1,2,3,4]. The new reshaped matrix is a 1 * 4 matrix, fill it row by row by using the previous list.</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input: 
nums = 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
r = 2, c = 4
Output: 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
Explanation:There is no way to reshape a 2 * 2 matrix to a 2 * 4 matrix. So output the original matrix.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>The height and width of the given matrix is in range [1, 100].
The given r and c are all positive.</p>
