<p>In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.</p>

<p>The given input is a graph that started as a tree with N nodes (with distinct values 1, 2, ..., N), with one additional edge added.  The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to N, and was not an edge that already existed.</p>

<p>The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of edges.  Each element of edges is a pair [u, v] with u &lt; v, that represents an undirected edge connecting nodes u and v.</p>

<p>Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of N nodes.  If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array.  The answer edge [u, v] should be in the same format, with u &lt; v.
Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
  1
 / \
2 - 3</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,4], [1,5]]
Output: [1,4]
Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
5 - 1 - 2
    |   |
    4 - 3</p>

<p>Note:
The size of the input 2D-array will be between 3 and 1000.
Every integer represented in the 2D-array will be between 1 and N, where N is the size of the input array.</p>

<p>Update (2017-09-26):
We have overhauled the problem description + test cases and specified clearly the graph is an undirected graph. For the directed graph follow up please see Redundant Connection II). We apologize for any inconvenience caused.</p>
