<p>The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.</p>

<p>Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<pre><code> 3
/ \
</code></pre>

<p>2   3
    \   \ 
     3   1</p>

<p>Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<pre><code> 3
/ \
</code></pre>

<p>4   5
  / \   \ 
 1   3   1</p>

<p>Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.</p>
