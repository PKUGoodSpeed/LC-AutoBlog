<p>Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest continuous increasing subsequence (subarray).</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3. 
Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4. </p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1. </p>

<p>Note:
Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.</p>
