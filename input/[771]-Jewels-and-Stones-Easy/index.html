</ul>

<p>You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.</p>

<p>The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<pre><code>S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
The characters in J are distinct.
