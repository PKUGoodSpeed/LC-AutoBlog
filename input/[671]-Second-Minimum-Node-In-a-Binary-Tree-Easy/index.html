<p>Given a non-empty special binary tree consisting of nodes with the non-negative value, where each node in this tree has exactly two or zero sub-node. If the node has two sub-nodes, then this node's value is the smaller value among its two sub-nodes. </p>

<p>Given such a binary tree, you need to output the second minimum value in the set made of all the nodes' value in the whole tree. </p>

<p>If no such second minimum value exists, output -1 instead.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: 
    2
   / \
  2   5
     / \
    5   7</p>

<p>Output: 5
Explanation: The smallest value is 2, the second smallest value is 5.</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input: 
    2
   / \
  2   2</p>

<p>Output: -1
Explanation: The smallest value is 2, but there isn't any second smallest value.</p>
