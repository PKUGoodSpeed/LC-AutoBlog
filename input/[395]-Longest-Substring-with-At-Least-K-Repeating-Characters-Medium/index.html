<p>Find the length of the longest substring T of a given string (consists of lowercase letters only) such that every character in T appears no less than k times.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input:
s = "aaabb", k = 3</p>

<p>Output:
3</p>

<p>The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input:
s = "ababbc", k = 2</p>

<p>Output:
5</p>

<p>The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.</p>
