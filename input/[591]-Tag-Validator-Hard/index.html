<p>Given a string representing a code snippet, you need to implement a tag validator to parse the code and return whether it is valid. A code snippet is valid if all the following rules hold:</p>

<p>The code must be wrapped in a valid closed tag. Otherwise, the code is invalid.
A closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : <TAG_NAME>TAG<em>CONTENT</TAG_NAME>. Among them, <TAG_NAME> is the start tag, and </TAG_NAME> is the end tag. The TAG</em>NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG<em>NAME and TAG</em>CONTENT are valid.
A valid TAG<em>NAME only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the TAG</em>NAME is invalid.
A valid TAG<em>CONTENT may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched &lt;, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG</em>NAME. Otherwise, the TAG<em>CONTENT is invalid.
A start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG</em>NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.
A &lt; is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent &gt;. And when you find a &lt; or </, all the subsequent characters until the next &gt; should be parsed as TAG<em>NAME  (not necessarily valid).
The cdata has the following format : <![CDATA[CDATA</em>CONTENT]]&gt;. The range of CDATA<em>CONTENT is defined as the characters between <![CDATA[ and the first subsequent ]]&gt;. 
CDATA</em>CONTENT may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse CDATA_CONTENT, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters. </p>

<p>Valid Code Examples:</p>

<p>Input: "<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]&gt;</DIV>"
Output: True
Explanation: 
The code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>. 
The TAG<em>NAME is valid, the TAG</em>CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata. 
Although CDATA<em>CONTENT has unmatched start tag with invalid TAG</em>NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as tag.
So TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true.</p>

<p>Input: "<DIV>&gt;&gt;  ![cdata[]] <![CDATA[<div>]&gt;]]&gt;]]&gt;&gt;]</DIV>"
Output: True
Explanation:
We first separate the code into : start<em>tag|tag</em>content|end<em>tag.
start</em>tag -> "<DIV>"
end<em>tag -> "</DIV>"
tag</em>content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2.
text1 -> ">&gt;  ![cdata[]] "
cdata -> "<![CDATA[<div>]&gt;]]&gt;", where the CDATA_CONTENT is "<div>]&gt;"
text2 -> "]]&gt;&gt;]"</p>

<p>The reason why start_tag is NOT "<DIV>&gt;&gt;" is because of the rule 6.
The reason why cdata is NOT "<![CDATA[<div>]&gt;]]&gt;]]&gt;" is because of the rule 7.</p>

<p>Invalid Code Examples:</p>

<p>Input: "<A>  <B> </A>   </B>"
Output: False
Explanation: Unbalanced. If "<A>" is closed, then "<B>" must be unmatched, and vice versa.</p>

<p>Input: "<DIV>  div tag is not closed  <DIV>"
Output: False</p>

<p>Input: "<DIV>  unmatched &lt;  </DIV>"
Output: False</p>

<p>Input: "<DIV> closed tags with invalid tag name  <b>123</b> </DIV>"
Output: False</p>

<p>Input: "<DIV> unmatched tags with invalid tag name  </1234567890> and <CDATA[[]]&gt;  </DIV>"
Output: False</p>

<p>Input: "<DIV>  unmatched start tag <B>  and unmatched end tag </C>  </DIV>"
Output: False</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>For simplicity, you could assume the input code (including the any characters mentioned above) only contain letters, digits, '&lt;','>','/','!','[',']' and ' '.</p>
