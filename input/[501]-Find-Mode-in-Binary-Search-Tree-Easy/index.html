<p>Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the mode(s) (the most frequently occurred element) in the given BST.</p>

<p>Assume a BST is defined as follows:</p>

<p>The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.</p>

<p>For example:
Given BST [1,null,2,2],</p>

<p>1
    \
     2
    /
   2</p>

<p>return [2].</p>

<p>Note:
If a tree has more than one mode, you can return them in any order.</p>

<p>Follow up:
Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).</p>
