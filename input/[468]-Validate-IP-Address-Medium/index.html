<p>Write a function to check whether an input string is a valid IPv4 address or IPv6 address or neither.</p>

<p>IPv4 addresses are canonically represented in dot-decimal notation, which consists of four decimal numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by dots ("."), e.g.,172.16.254.1;</p>

<p>Besides, leading zeros in the IPv4 is invalid. For example, the address 172.16.254.01 is invalid.</p>

<p>IPv6 addresses are represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, each group representing 16 bits. The groups are separated by colons (":"). For example, the address 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 is a valid one. Also, we could omit some leading zeros among four hexadecimal digits and some low-case characters in the address to upper-case ones, so 2001:db8:85a3:0:0:8A2E:0370:7334 is also a valid IPv6 address(Omit leading zeros and using upper cases).</p>

<p>However, we don't replace a consecutive group of zero value with a single empty group using two consecutive colons (::) to pursue simplicity. For example, 2001:0db8:85a3::8A2E:0370:7334 is an invalid IPv6 address.</p>

<p>Besides, extra leading zeros in the IPv6 is also invalid. For example, the address 02001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 is invalid.</p>

<p>Note:
You may assume there is no extra space or special characters in the input string.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: "172.16.254.1"</p>

<p>Output: "IPv4"</p>

<p>Explanation: This is a valid IPv4 address, return "IPv4".</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input: "2001:0db8:85a3:0:0:8A2E:0370:7334"</p>

<p>Output: "IPv6"</p>

<p>Explanation: This is a valid IPv6 address, return "IPv6".</p>

<p>Example 3:</p>

<p>Input: "256.256.256.256"</p>

<p>Output: "Neither"</p>

<p>Explanation: This is neither a IPv4 address nor a IPv6 address.</p>
