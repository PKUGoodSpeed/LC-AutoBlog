<p>We are stacking blocks to form a pyramid.  Each block has a color which is a one letter string, like <code>'Z'</code>.</p>

<p>For every block of color <code>C</code> we place not in the bottom row, we are placing it on top of a left block of color <code>A</code> and right block of color <code>B</code>.  We are allowed to place the block there only if <code>(A, B, C)</code> is an allowed triple.</p>

<p>We start with a bottom row of bottom, represented as a single string.  We also start with a list of allowed triples allowed.  Each allowed triple is represented as a string of length 3.</p>

<p>Return true if we can build the pyramid all the way to the top, otherwise false.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: bottom = "XYZ", allowed = ["XYD", "YZE", "DEA", "FFF"]
Output: true
Explanation:
We can stack the pyramid like this:
    A
   / \
  D   E
 / \ / \
X   Y   Z</p>

<p>This works because ('X', 'Y', 'D'), ('Y', 'Z', 'E'), and ('D', 'E', 'A') are allowed triples.</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input: bottom = "XXYX", allowed = ["XXX", "XXY", "XYX", "XYY", "YXZ"]
Output: false
Explanation:
We can't stack the pyramid to the top.
Note that there could be allowed triples (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) with C != D.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>bottom will be a string with length in range [2, 8].
allowed will have length in range [0, 200].
Letters in all strings will be chosen from the set {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'}.</p>
