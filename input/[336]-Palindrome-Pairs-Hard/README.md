    Given a list of unique words, find all pairs of distinct indices (i, j) in the given list, so that the concatenation of the two words, i.e. words[i] + words[j] is a palindrome.



    Example 1:
    Given words = ["bat", "tab", "cat"]
    Return [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
    The palindromes are ["battab", "tabbat"]


    Example 2:
    Given words = ["abcd", "dcba", "lls", "s", "sssll"]
    Return [[0, 1], [1, 0], [3, 2], [2, 4]]
    The palindromes are ["dcbaabcd", "abcddcba", "slls", "llssssll"]
