<li>Testcase Example:  '{"headers": {"Employee": ["Id", "Name", "Salary", "ManagerId"]}, "rows": {"Employee": [[1, "Joe", 70000, 3], [2, "Henry", 80000, 4], [3, "Sam", 60000, null], [4, "Max", 90000, null]]}}'</li>
</ul>

<p>The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.</p>

<p>+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | ManagerId |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | NULL      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | NULL      |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+</p>

<p>Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out employees who earn more than their managers. For the above table, Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.</p>

| Employee |

| Joe      |
