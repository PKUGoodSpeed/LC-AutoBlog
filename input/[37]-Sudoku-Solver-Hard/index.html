<p>A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:</p>

<pre><code>Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
Each of the the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.
</code></pre>

<p>Empty cells are indicated by the character '.'.</p>

<p>A sudoku puzzle...</p>

<p>...and its solution numbers marked in red.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<pre><code>The given board contain only digits 1-9 and the character '.'.
You may assume that the given Sudoku puzzle will have a single unique solution.
The given board size is always 9x9.
