<p>Given an array nums of integers, you can perform operations on the array.</p>

<p>In each operation, you pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points.  After, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 or nums[i] + 1.</p>

<p>You start with 0 points.  Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying such operations.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: nums = [3, 4, 2]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
Delete 4 to earn 4 points, consequently 3 is also deleted.
Then, delete 2 to earn 2 points. 6 total points are earned.</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input: nums = [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]
Output: 9
Explanation: 
Delete 3 to earn 3 points, deleting both 2's and the 4.
Then, delete 3 again to earn 3 points, and 3 again to earn 3 points.
9 total points are earned.</p>

<p>Note:
The length of nums is at most 20000.
Each element nums[i] is an integer in the range [1, 10000].</p>
