<p>Write a bash script to calculate the frequency of each word in a text file words.txt.</p>

<p>For simplicity sake, you may assume:</p>

<pre><code>words.txt contains only lowercase characters and space ' ' characters.
Each word must consist of lowercase characters only.
Words are separated by one or more whitespace characters.
</code></pre>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>Assume that words.txt has the following content:</p>

<p>the day is sunny the the
the sunny is is</p>

<p>Your script should output the following, sorted by descending frequency:</p>

<p>the 4
is 3
sunny 2
day 1</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<pre><code>Don't worry about handling ties, it is guaranteed that each word's frequency count is unique.
Could you write it in one-line using Unix pipes?
