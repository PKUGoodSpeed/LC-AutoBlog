<p>There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.</p>

<p>Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]</p>

<p>Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.</p>

<p>There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished <br />
             course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1] .</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input: 4, [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,1,2,3] or [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both <br />
             courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0. 
             So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3] .</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<pre><code>The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
