<p>We have two special characters. The first character can be represented by one bit 0. The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).  </p>

<p>Now given a string represented by several bits. Return whether the last character must be a one-bit character or not. The given string will always end with a zero.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: 
bits = [1, 0, 0]
Output: True
Explanation: 
The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character. So the last character is one-bit character.</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input: 
bits = [1, 1, 1, 0]
Output: False
Explanation: 
The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character. So the last character is NOT one-bit character.</p>

<p>Note:
1 .
bits[i] is always 0 or 1.</p>
