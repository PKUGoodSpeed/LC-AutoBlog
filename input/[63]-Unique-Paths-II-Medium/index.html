<p>A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).</p>

<p>The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).</p>

<p>Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?</p>

<p>An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.</p>

<p>Note: m and n will be at most 100.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input:
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 2
Explanation:
There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right</p>
