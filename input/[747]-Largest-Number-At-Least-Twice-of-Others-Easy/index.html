<p>In a given integer array nums, there is always exactly one largest element.</p>

<p>Find whether the largest element in the array is at least twice as much as every other number in the array.</p>

<p>If it is, return the index of the largest element, otherwise return -1.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: nums = [3, 6, 1, 0]
Output: 1
Explanation: 6 is the largest integer, and for every other number in the array x,
6 is more than twice as big as x.  The index of value 6 is 1, so we return 1.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: -1
Explanation: 4 isn't at least as big as twice the value of 3, so we return -1.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Note:</p>

<pre><code>nums will have a length in the range [1, 50].
</code></pre>

<p>Every nums[i] will be an integer in the range [0, 99].</p>
