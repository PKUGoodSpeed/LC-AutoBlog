<p>Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would compete for water and both would die.</p>

<p>Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty), and a number n, return if n new flowers can be planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: True</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: False</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>The input array won't violate no-adjacent-flowers rule.
The input array size is in the range of [1, 20000].
n is a non-negative integer which won't exceed the input array size.</p>
