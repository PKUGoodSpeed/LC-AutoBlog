<p>Mary is a teacher in a middle school and she has a table seat storing students' names and their corresponding seat ids.
The column id is continuous increment.
Mary wants to change seats for the adjacent students.
Can you write a SQL query to output the result for Mary?</p>

<p>+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Abbot   |
|    2    | Doris   |
|    3    | Emerson |
|    4    | Green   |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+</p>

<p>For the sample input, the output is:</p>

<p>+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Doris   |
|    2    | Abbot   |
|    3    | Green   |
|    4    | Emerson |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+</p>

<p>Note:
If the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.</p>
