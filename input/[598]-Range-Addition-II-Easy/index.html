<p>Given an m * n matrix M initialized with all 0's and several update operations.
Operations are represented by a 2D array, and each operation is represented by an array with two positive integers a and b, which means M[i][j] should be added by one for all 0  and 0 . 
You need to count and return the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: 
m = 3, n = 3
operations = [[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
Initially, M = 
[[0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0]]</p>

<p>After performing [2,2], M = 
[[1, 1, 0],
 [1, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 0]]</p>

<p>After performing [3,3], M = 
[[2, 2, 1],
 [2, 2, 1],
 [1, 1, 1]]</p>

<p>So the maximum integer in M is 2, and there are four of it in M. So return 4.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>The range of m and n is [1,40000].
The range of a is [1,m], and the range of b is [1,n].
The range of operations size won't exceed 10,000.</p>
