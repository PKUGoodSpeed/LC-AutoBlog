<p>Given a set of intervals, for each of the interval i, check if there exists an interval j whose start point is bigger than or equal to the end point of the interval i, which can be called that j is on the "right" of i.</p>

<p>For any interval i, you need to store the minimum interval j's index, which means that the interval j has the minimum start point to build the "right" relationship for interval i. If the interval j doesn't exist, store -1 for the interval i. Finally, you need output the stored value of each interval as an array.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
You may assume none of these intervals have the same start point.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: [ [1,2] ]</p>

<p>Output: [-1]</p>

<p>Explanation: There is only one interval in the collection, so it outputs -1.</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input: [ [3,4], [2,3], [1,2] ]</p>

<p>Output: [-1, 0, 1]</p>

<p>Explanation: There is no satisfied "right" interval for [3,4].
For [2,3], the interval [3,4] has minimum-"right" start point;
For [1,2], the interval [2,3] has minimum-"right" start point.</p>

<p>Example 3:</p>

<p>Input: [ [1,4], [2,3], [3,4] ]</p>

<p>Output: [-1, 2, -1]</p>

<p>Explanation: There is no satisfied "right" interval for [1,4] and [3,4].
For [2,3], the interval [3,4] has minimum-"right" start point.</p>
