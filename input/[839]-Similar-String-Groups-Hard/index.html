<p>Two strings X and Y are similar if we can swap two letters (in different positions) of X, so that it equals Y.</p>

<p>For example, "tars" and "rats" are similar (swapping at positions 0 and 2), and "rats" and "arts" are similar, but "star" is not similar to "tars", "rats", or "arts".</p>

<p>Together, these form two connected groups by similarity: {"tars", "rats", "arts"} and {"star"}.  Notice that "tars" and "arts" are in the same group even though they are not similar.  Formally, each group is such that a word is in the group if and only if it is similar to at least one other word in the group.</p>

<p>We are given a list A of strings.  Every string in A is an anagram of every other string in A.  How many groups are there?</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: ["tars","rats","arts","star"]
Output: 2</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<pre><code>A.length &lt;= 2000
A[i].length &lt;= 1000
A.length * A[i].length &lt;= 20000
All words in A consist of lowercase letters only.
All words in A have the same length and are anagrams of each other.
The judging time limit has been increased for this question.
