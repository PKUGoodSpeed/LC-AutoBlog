<p>An N x N board contains only 0s and 1s. In each move, you can swap any 2 rows with each other, or any 2 columns with each other.</p>

<p>What is the minimum number of moves to transform the board into a "chessboard" - a board where no 0s and no 1s are 4-directionally adjacent? If the task is impossible, return -1.</p>

<p>Examples:
Input: board = [[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[1,0,0,1],[1,0,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation:
One potential sequence of moves is shown below, from left to right:</p>

<p>0110     1010     1010
0110 --> 1010 --> 0101
1001     0101     1010
1001     0101     0101</p>

<p>The first move swaps the first and second column.
The second move swaps the second and third row.</p>

<p>Input: board = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Output: 0
Explanation:
Also note that the board with 0 in the top left corner,
01
10</p>

<p>is also a valid chessboard.</p>

<p>Input: board = [[1, 0], [1, 0]]
Output: -1
Explanation:
No matter what sequence of moves you make, you cannot end with a valid chessboard.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<pre><code>board will have the same number of rows and columns, a number in the range [2, 30].
board[i][j] will be only 0s or 1s.
</code></pre>
