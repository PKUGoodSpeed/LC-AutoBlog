<p>The demons had captured the princess (P) and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of M x N rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight (K) was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the princess.</p>

<p>The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.</p>

<p>Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health (negative integers) upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (0's) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (positive integers).</p>

<p>In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Write a function to determine the knight's minimum initial health so that he is able to rescue the princess.</p>

<p>For example, given the dungeon below, the initial health of the knight must be at least 7 if he follows the optimal path RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN.</p>

<p>-2 (K)
            -3
            3</p>

<p>-5
            -10
            1</p>

<p>10
            30
            -5 (P)</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Note:</p>

<pre><code>The knight's health has no upper bound.
Any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.
