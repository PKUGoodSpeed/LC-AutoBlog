<p>Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program source is an array where source[i] is the i-th line of the source code.  This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character \n.</p>

<p>In C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.</p>

<p>The string // denotes a line comment, which represents that it and rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.</p>

<p>The string /* denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of <em>/ should be ignored.  (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.)  To be clear, the string /</em>/ does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.</p>

<p>The first effective comment takes precedence over others: if the string // occurs in a block comment, it is ignored. Similarly, if the string /* occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.</p>

<p>If a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.</p>

<p>There will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.  For example, source = "string s = "/* Not a comment. */";" will not be a test case.  (Also, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.)</p>

<p>It is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so /* outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.</p>

<p>Finally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments.  Please see the examples below for details.</p>

<p>After removing the comments from the source code, return the source code in the same format.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: 
source = ["/<em>Test program */", "int main()", "{ ", "  // variable declaration ", "int a, b, c;", "/</em> This is a test", "   multiline  ", "   comment for ", "   testing */", "a = b + c;", "}"]</p>

<p>The line by line code is visualized as below:
/<em>Test program */
int main()
{ 
  // variable declaration 
int a, b, c;
/</em> This is a test
   multiline <br />
   comment for 
   testing */
a = b + c;
}</p>

<p>Output: ["int main()","{ ","  ","int a, b, c;","a = b + c;","}"]</p>

<p>The line by line code is visualized as below:
int main()
{ </p>

<p>int a, b, c;
a = b + c;
}</p>

<p>Explanation: 
The string /* denotes a block comment, including line 1 and lines 6-9. The string // denotes line 4 as comments.</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input: 
source = ["a/<em>comment", "line", "more_comment</em>/b"]
Output: ["ab"]
Explanation: The original source string is "a/<em>comment\nline\nmore_comment</em>/b", where we have bolded the newline characters.  After deletion, the implicit newline characters are deleted, leaving the string "ab", which when delimited by newline characters becomes ["ab"].</p>

<p>Note:
The length of source is in the range [1, 100].
The length of source[i] is in the range [0, 80].
Every open block comment is eventually closed.
There are no single-quote, double-quote, or control characters in the source code.</p>
