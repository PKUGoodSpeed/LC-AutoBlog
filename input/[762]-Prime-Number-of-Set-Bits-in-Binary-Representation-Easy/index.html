<p>Given two integers L and R, find the count of numbers in the range [L, R] (inclusive) having a prime number of set bits in their binary representation.</p>

<p>(Recall that the number of set bits an integer has is the number of 1s present when written in binary.  For example, 21 written in binary is 10101 which has 3 set bits.  Also, 1 is not a prime.)</p>

<p>Example 1:
Input: L = 6, R = 10
Output: 4
Explanation:
6 -> 110 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
7 -> 111 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
9 -> 1001 (2 set bits , 2 is prime)
10->1010 (2 set bits , 2 is prime)</p>

<p>Example 2:
Input: L = 10, R = 15
Output: 5
Explanation:
10 -> 1010 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
11 -> 1011 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
12 -> 1100 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
13 -> 1101 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
14 -> 1110 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
15 -> 1111 (4 set bits, 4 is not prime)</p>

<p>Note:
L, R will be integers L  in the range [1, 10^6].
R - L will be at most 10000.</p>
