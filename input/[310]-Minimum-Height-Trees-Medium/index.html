<p>For a undirected graph with tree characteristics, we can choose any node as the root. The result graph is then a rooted tree. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height are called minimum height trees (MHTs). Given such a graph, write a function to find all the MHTs and return a list of their root labels.</p>

<p>Format
The graph contains n nodes which are labeled from 0 to n - 1. You will be given the number n and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of labels).</p>

<p>You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.</p>

<p>Example 1 :</p>

<p>Input: n = 4, edges = [[1, 0], [1, 2], [1, 3]]</p>

<pre><code>    0
    |
    1
   / \
  2   3
</code></pre>

<p>Output: [1]</p>

<p>Example 2 :</p>

<p>Input: n = 6, edges = [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [4, 3], [5, 4]]</p>

<pre><code> 0  1  2
  \ | /
    3
    |
    4
    |
    5
</code></pre>

<p>Output: [3, 4]</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<pre><code>According to the definition of tree on Wikipedia: “a tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.”
The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.
