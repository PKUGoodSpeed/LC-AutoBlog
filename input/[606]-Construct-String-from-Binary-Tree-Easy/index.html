<p>You need to construct a string consists of parenthesis and integers from a binary tree with the preorder traversing way.</p>

<p>The null node needs to be represented by empty parenthesis pair "()". And you need to omit all the empty parenthesis pairs that don't affect the one-to-one mapping relationship between the string and the original binary tree.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: Binary tree: [1,2,3,4]
       1
     /   \
    2     3
   / <br />
  4     </p>

<p>Output: "1(2(4))(3)"
Explanation: Originallay it needs to be "1(2(4)())(3()())", but you need to omit all the unnecessary empty parenthesis pairs. And it will be "1(2(4))(3)".</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input: Binary tree: [1,2,3,null,4]
       1
     /   \
    2     3
     \ <br />
      4 </p>

<p>Output: "1(2()(4))(3)"
Explanation: Almost the same as the first example, except we can't omit the first parenthesis pair to break the one-to-one mapping relationship between the input and the output.</p>
