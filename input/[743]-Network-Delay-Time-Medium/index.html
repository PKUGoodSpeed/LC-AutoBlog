<p>There are N network nodes, labelled 1 to N.</p>

<p>Given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (u, v, w), where u is the source node, v is the target node, and w is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.</p>

<p>Now, we send a signal from a certain node K.  How long will it take for all nodes to receive the signal?  If it is impossible, return -1.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>N will be in the range [1, 100].
K will be in the range [1, N].
The length of times will be in the range [1, 6000].
All edges times[i] = (u, v, w) will have 1  and 1 .</p>
