<p>In a given array nums of positive integers, find three non-overlapping subarrays with maximum sum.</p>

<p>Each subarray will be of size k, and we want to maximize the sum of all 3*k entries.</p>

<p>Return the result as a list of indices representing the starting position of each interval (0-indexed).  If there are multiple answers, return the lexicographically smallest one.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>Input: [1,2,1,2,6,7,5,1], 2
Output: [0, 3, 5]
Explanation: Subarrays [1, 2], [2, 6], [7, 5] correspond to the starting indices [0, 3, 5].
We could have also taken [2, 1], but an answer of [1, 3, 5] would be lexicographically larger.</p>

<p>Note:
nums.length will be between 1 and 20000.
nums[i] will be between 1 and 65535.
k will be between 1 and floor(nums.length / 3).</p>
