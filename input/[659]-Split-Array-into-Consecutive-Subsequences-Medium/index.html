<p>You are given an integer array sorted in ascending order (may contain duplicates), you need to split them into several subsequences, where each subsequences consist of at least 3 consecutive integers. Return whether you can make such a split.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: [1,2,3,3,4,5]
Output: True
Explanation:
You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
1, 2, 3
3, 4, 5</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input: [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]
Output: True
Explanation:
You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
3, 4, 5</p>

<p>Example 3:</p>

<p>Input: [1,2,3,4,4,5]
Output: False</p>
