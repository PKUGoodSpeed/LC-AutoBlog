<p>Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.</p>

<p>Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k transactions.</p>

<p>Note:
You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: [2,4,1], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input: [3,2,6,5,0,3], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4.
Â             Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.</p>
