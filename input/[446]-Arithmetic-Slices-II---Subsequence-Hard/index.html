<p>A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.</p>

<p>For example, these are arithmetic sequences:
1, 3, 5, 7, 9
7, 7, 7, 7
3, -1, -5, -9</p>

<p>The following sequence is not arithmetic. 1, 1, 2, 5, 7 </p>

<p>A zero-indexed array A consisting of N numbers is given. A subsequence slice of that array is any sequence of integers (P0, P1, ..., Pk) such that 0 ≤ P0 &lt; P1 &lt; ... &lt; Pk &lt; N.</p>

<p>A subsequence slice (P0, P1, ..., Pk) of array A is called arithmetic if the sequence A[P0], A[P1], ..., A[Pk-1], A[Pk] is arithmetic. In particular, this means that k ≥ 2.</p>

<p>The function should return the number of arithmetic subsequence slices in the array A. </p>

<p>The input contains N integers. Every integer is in the range of -231 and 231-1 and 0 ≤ N ≤ 1000. The output is guaranteed to be less than 231-1.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>Input: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]</p>

<p>Output: 7</p>

<p>Explanation:
All arithmetic subsequence slices are:
[2,4,6]
[4,6,8]
[6,8,10]
[2,4,6,8]
[4,6,8,10]
[2,4,6,8,10]
[2,6,10]</p>
