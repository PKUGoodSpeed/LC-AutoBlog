<p>A string S of lowercase letters is given.  We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.</p>

<p>Note:
S will have length in range [1, 500].
S will consist of lowercase letters ('a' to 'z') only.</p>
