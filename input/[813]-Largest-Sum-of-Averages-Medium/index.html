<p>We partition a row of numbers A into at most K adjacent (non-empty) groups, then our score is the sum of the average of each group. What is the largest score we can achieve?</p>

<p>Note that our partition must use every number in A, and that scores are not necessarily integers.</p>

<p>Example:
Input: 
A = [9,1,2,3,9]
K = 3
Output: 20
Explanation: 
The best choice is to partition A into [9], [1, 2, 3], [9]. The answer is 9 + (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 + 9 = 20.
We could have also partitioned A into [9, 1], [2], [3, 9], for example.
That partition would lead to a score of 5 + 2 + 6 = 13, which is worse.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Note: </p>

<pre><code>1 &lt;= A.length &lt;= 100.
1 &lt;= A[i] &lt;= 10000.
1 &lt;= K &lt;= A.length.
Answers within 10^-6 of the correct answer will be accepted as correct.
