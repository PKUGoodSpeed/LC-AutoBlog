<p>Given a string array words, find the maximum value of length(word[i]) * length(word[j]) where the two words do not share common letters. You may assume that each word will contain only lower case letters. If no such two words exist, return 0.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: ["abcw","baz","foo","bar","xtfn","abcdef"]
Output: 16 
Explanation: The two words can be "abcw", "xtfn".</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input: ["a","ab","abc","d","cd","bcd","abcd"]
Output: 4 
Explanation: The two words can be "ab", "cd".</p>

<p>Example 3:</p>

<p>Input: ["a","aa","aaa","aaaa"]
Output: 0
