            <h2>[798]-Smallest-Rotation-with-Highest-Score-Hard</h2><p>[798] Smallest Rotation with Highest Score  </p>

<p>https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-rotation-with-highest-score/description/</p>

<ul>
<li>algorithms</li>
<li>Hard (33.13%)</li>
<li>Total Accepted:    1.9K</li>
<li>Total Submissions: 5.8K</li>
<li><p>Testcase Example:  '[2,3,1,4,0]'</p>

<p> Given an array A, we may rotate it by a non-negative integer K so that the array becomes A[K], A[K+1], A{K+2], ... A[A.length - 1], A[0], A[1], ..., A[K-1].  Afterward, any entries that are less than or equal to their index are worth 1 point. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>For example, if we have [2, 4, 1, 3, 0], and we rotate by K = 2, it becomes [1, 3, 0, 2, 4].  This is worth 3 points because 1 &gt; 0 [no points], 3 &gt; 1 [no points], 0 &lt;= 2 [one point], 2 &lt;= 3 [one point], 4 &lt;= 4 [one point].</p>

<p>Over all possible rotations, return the rotation index K that corresponds to the highest score we could receive.  If there are multiple answers, return the smallest such index K.</p>

<p>Example 1:
Input: [2, 3, 1, 4, 0]
Output: 3
Explanation: <br />
Scores for each K are listed below: 
K = 0,  A = [2,3,1,4,0],    score 2
K = 1,  A = [3,1,4,0,2],    score 3
K = 2,  A = [1,4,0,2,3],    score 3
K = 3,  A = [4,0,2,3,1],    score 4
K = 4,  A = [0,2,3,1,4],    score 3</p>

<p>So we should choose K = 3, which has the highest score.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Example 2:
Input: [1, 3, 0, 2, 4]
Output: 0
Explanation:  A will always have 3 points no matter how it shifts.
So we will choose the smallest K, which is 0.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<pre><code>A will have length at most 20000.
A[i] will be in the range [0, A.length].
