<p>Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment. </p>

<p>Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary search tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.</p>

<p>The encoded string should be as compact as possible.</p>

<p>Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.</p>
