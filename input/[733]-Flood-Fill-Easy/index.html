</ul>

<p>An image is represented by a 2-D array of integers, each integer representing the pixel value of the image (from 0 to 65535).</p>

<p>Given a coordinate (sr, sc) representing the starting pixel (row and column) of the flood fill, and a pixel value newColor, "flood fill" the image.</p>

<p>To perform a "flood fill", consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color as the starting pixel), and so on.  Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with the newColor.</p>

<p>At the end, return the modified image.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: 
image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]]
sr = 1, sc = 1, newColor = 2
Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]
Explanation: 
From the center of the image (with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1)), all pixels connected 
by a path of the same color as the starting pixel are colored with the new color.
Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not 4-directionally connected
to the starting pixel.</p>

<p>Note:
The length of image and image[0] will be in the range [1, 50].
The given starting pixel will satisfy 0  and 0 .
The value of each color in image[i][j] and newColor will be an integer in [0, 65535].</p>
