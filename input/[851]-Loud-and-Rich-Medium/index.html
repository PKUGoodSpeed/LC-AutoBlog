<p>In a group of N people (labelled 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1), each person has different amounts of money, and different levels of quietness.</p>

<p>For convenience, we'll call the person with label x, simply "person x".</p>

<p>We'll say that richer[i] = [x, y] if person x definitely has more money than person y.  Note that richer may only be a subset of valid observations.</p>

<p>Also, we'll say quiet[x] = q if person x has quietness q.</p>

<p>Now, return answer, where answer[x] = y if y is the least quiet person (that is, the person y with the smallest value of quiet[y]), among all people who definitely have equal to or more money than person x.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: richer = [[1,0],[2,1],[3,1],[3,7],[4,3],[5,3],[6,3]], quiet = [3,2,5,4,6,1,7,0]
Output: [5,5,2,5,4,5,6,7]
Explanation: 
answer[0] = 5.
Person 5 has more money than 3, which has more money than 1, which has more money than 0.
The only person who is quieter (has lower quiet[x]) is person 7, but
it isn't clear if they have more money than person 0.</p>

<p>answer[7] = 7.
Among all people that definitely have equal to or more money than person 7
(which could be persons 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7), the person who is the quietest (has lower quiet[x])
is person 7.</p>

<p>The other answers can be filled out with similar reasoning.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<pre><code>1 &lt;= quiet.length = N &lt;= 500
0 &lt;= quiet[i] &lt; N, all quiet[i] are different.
0 &lt;= richer.length &lt;= N * (N-1) / 2
0 &lt;= richer[i][j] &lt; N
richer[i][0] != richer[i][1]
richer[i]'s are all different.
The observations in richer are all logically consistent.
