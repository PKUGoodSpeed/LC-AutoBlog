<p>Given a (singly) linked list with head node root, write a function to split the linked list into k consecutive linked list "parts".</p>

<p>The length of each part should be as equal as possible: no two parts should have a size differing by more than 1.  This may lead to some parts being null.</p>

<p>The parts should be in order of occurrence in the input list, and parts occurring earlier should always have a size greater than or equal parts occurring later.</p>

<p>Return a List of ListNode's representing the linked list parts that are formed.</p>

<p>Examples
1->2->3->4, k = 5 // 5 equal parts
[ [1], 
[2],
[3],
[4],
null ]</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: 
root = [1, 2, 3], k = 5
Output: [[1],[2],[3],[],[]]
Explanation:
The input and each element of the output are ListNodes, not arrays.
For example, the input root has root.val = 1, root.next.val = 2, \root.next.next.val = 3, and root.next.next.next = null.
The first element output[0] has output[0].val = 1, output[0].next = null.
The last element output[4] is null, but it's string representation as a ListNode is [].</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input: 
root = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], k = 3
Output: [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 10]]
Explanation:
The input has been split into consecutive parts with size difference at most 1, and earlier parts are a larger size than the later parts.</p>

<p>Note:
The length of root will be in the range [0, 1000].
Each value of a node in the input will be an integer in the range [0, 999].
k will be an integer in the range [1, 50].</p>
