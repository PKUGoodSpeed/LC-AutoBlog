<p>Given an array of characters, compress it in-place.</p>

<p>The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.</p>

<p>Every element of the array should be a character (not int) of length 1.</p>

<p>After you are done modifying the input array in-place, return the new length of the array.</p>

<p>Follow up:
Could you solve it using only O(1) extra space?</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input:
["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]</p>

<p>Output:
Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]</p>

<p>Explanation:
"aa" is replaced by "a2". "bb" is replaced by "b2". "ccc" is replaced by "c3".</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input:
["a"]</p>

<p>Output:
Return 1, and the first 1 characters of the input array should be: ["a"]</p>

<p>Explanation:
Nothing is replaced.</p>

<p>Example 3:</p>

<p>Input:
["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]</p>

<p>Output:
Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].</p>

<p>Explanation:
Since the character "a" does not repeat, it is not compressed. "bbbbbbbbbbbb" is replaced by "b12".
Notice each digit has it's own entry in the array.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>All characters have an ASCII value in [35, 126].
