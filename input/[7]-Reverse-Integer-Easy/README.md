Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

Example 1:


Input: 123
Output: 321


Example 2:


Input: -123
Output: -321


Example 3:


Input: 120
Output: 21


Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
