</ul>

<p>To some string S, we will perform some replacement operations that replace groups of letters with new ones (not necessarily the same size).</p>

<p>Each replacement operation has 3 parameters: a starting index i, a source word x and a target word y.  The rule is that if x starts at position i in the original string S, then we will replace that occurrence of x with y.  If not, we do nothing.</p>

<p>For example, if we have S = "abcd" and we have some replacement operation i = 2, x = "cd", y = "ffff", then because "cd" starts at position 2 in the original string S, we will replace it with "ffff".</p>

<p>Using another example on S = "abcd", if we have both the replacement operation i = 0, x = "ab", y = "eee", as well as another replacement operation i = 2, x = "ec", y = "ffff", this second operation does nothing because in the original string S[2] = 'c', which doesn't match x[0] = 'e'.</p>

<p>All these operations occur simultaneously.  It's guaranteed that there won't be any overlap in replacement: for example, S = "abc", indexes = [0, 1], sources = ["ab","bc"] is not a valid test case.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: S = "abcd", indexes = [0,2], sources = ["a","cd"], targets = ["eee","ffff"]
Output: "eeebffff"
Explanation: "a" starts at index 0 in S, so it's replaced by "eee".
"cd" starts at index 2 in S, so it's replaced by "ffff".</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input: S = "abcd", indexes = [0,2], sources = ["ab","ec"], targets = ["eee","ffff"]
Output: "eeecd"
Explanation: "ab" starts at index 0 in S, so it's replaced by "eee". 
"ec" doesn't starts at index 2 in the original S, so we do nothing.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<pre><code>0 &lt;= indexes.length = sources.length = targets.length &lt;= 100
0 &lt; indexes[i] &lt; S.length &lt;= 1000
</code></pre>

<p>All characters in given inputs are lowercase letters.</p>
