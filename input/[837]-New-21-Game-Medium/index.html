<p>Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".</p>

<p>Alice starts with 0 points, and draws numbers while she has less than K points.  During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range [1, W], where W is an integer.  Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.</p>

<p>Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets K or more points.  What is the probability that she has N or less points?</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: N = 10, K = 1, W = 10
Output: 1.00000
Explanation:  Alice gets a single card, then stops.</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input: N = 6, K = 1, W = 10
Output: 0.60000
Explanation:  Alice gets a single card, then stops.
In 6 out of W = 10 possibilities, she is at or below N = 6 points.</p>

<p>Example 3:</p>

<p>Input: N = 21, K = 17, W = 10
Output: 0.73278</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<pre><code>0 &lt;= K &lt;= N &lt;= 10000
1 &lt;= W &lt;= 10000
Answers will be accepted as correct if they are within 10^-5 of the correct answer.
