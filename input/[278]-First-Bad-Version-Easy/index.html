<p>You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.</p>

<p>Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.</p>

<p>You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>Given n = 5, and version = 4 is the first bad version.</p>

<p>call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true</p>

<p>Then 4 is the first bad version. </p>
