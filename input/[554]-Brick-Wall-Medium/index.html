<p>There is a brick wall in front of you. The wall is rectangular and has several rows of bricks. The bricks have the same height but different width. You want to draw a vertical line from the top to the bottom and cross the least bricks. </p>

<p>The brick wall is represented by a list of rows. Each row is a list of integers representing the width of each brick in this row from left to right. </p>

<p>If your line go through the edge of a brick, then the brick is not considered as crossed. You need to find out how to draw the line to cross the least bricks and return the number of crossed bricks. </p>

<p>You cannot draw a line just along one of the two vertical edges of the wall, in which case the line will obviously cross no bricks. </p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>Input: 
[[1,2,2,1],
 [3,1,2],
 [1,3,2],
 [2,4],
 [3,1,2],
 [1,3,1,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: </p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>The width sum of bricks in different rows are the same and won't exceed INT_MAX.
The number of bricks in each row is in range [1,10,000]. The height of wall is in range [1,10,000]. Total number of bricks of the wall won't exceed 20,000. </p>
