<p>Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor gi, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size sj. If sj &gt;= gi, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.</p>

<p>Note:
You may assume the greed factor is always positive. 
You cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: [1,2,3], [1,1]</p>

<p>Output: 1</p>

<p>Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input: [1,2], [1,2,3]</p>

<p>Output: 2</p>

<p>Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2.</p>
