<p>We have two types of tiles: a 2x1 domino shape, and an "L" tromino shape. These shapes may be rotated.</p>

<p>XX  &lt;- domino</p>

<p>XX  &lt;- "L" tromino
X</p>

<p>Given N, how many ways are there to tile a 2 x N board? Return your answer modulo 10^9 + 7.</p>

<p>(In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.)</p>

<p>Example:
Input: 3
Output: 5
Explanation: 
The five different ways are listed below, different letters indicates different tiles:
XYZ XXZ XYY XXY XYY
XYZ YYZ XZZ XYY XXY</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>N  will be in range [1, 1000].</p>
