<p>There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.</p>

<p>Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]</p>

<p>Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<pre><code>The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
