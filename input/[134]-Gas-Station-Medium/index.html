<p>There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].</p>

<p>You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.</p>

<p>Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<pre><code>If there exists aÂ solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.
</code></pre>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: 
gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
cost = [3,4,5,1,2]</p>

<p>Output: 3</p>

<p>Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input: 
gas  = [2,3,4]
cost = [3,4,3]</p>

<p>Output: -1</p>

<p>Explanation:
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.</p>
