<p>Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.</p>

<p>Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Given nums = [1,1,2],</p>

<p>Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],</p>

<p>Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.</p>

<p>Clarification:</p>

<p>Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?</p>

<p>Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.</p>

<p>Internally you can think of this:</p>

<p>// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);</p>

<p>// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}</p>
