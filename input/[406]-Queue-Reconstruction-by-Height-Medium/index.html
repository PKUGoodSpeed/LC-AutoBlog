</ul>

<p>Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k), where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.</p>

<p>Note:
The number of people is less than 1,100.</p>

<p>Example</p>

<p>Input:
[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]</p>

<p>Output:
[[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]</p>
