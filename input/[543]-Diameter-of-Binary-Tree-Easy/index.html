<p>Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.</p>

<p>Example:
Given a binary tree </p>

<pre><code>      1
     / \
    2   3
   / \     
  4   5
</code></pre>

<p>Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].</p>

<p>Note:
The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.</p>
