<p>There is a strange printer with the following two special requirements:</p>

<p>The printer can only print a sequence of the same character each time.
At each turn, the printer can print new characters starting from and ending at any places, and will cover the original existing characters.</p>

<p>Given a string consists of lower English letters only, your job is to count the minimum number of turns the printer needed in order to print it.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: "aaabbb"
Output: 2
Explanation: Print "aaa" first and then print "bbb".</p>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input: "aba"
Output: 2
Explanation: Print "aaa" first and then print "b" from the second place of the string, which will cover the existing character 'a'.</p>

<p>Hint: Length of the given string will not exceed 100.</p>
