<p>In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other words to form another longer word - let's call this word successor. For example, the root an, followed by other, which can form another word another.</p>

<p>Now, given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence. You need to replace all the successor in the sentence with the root forming it. If a successor has many roots can form it, replace it with the root with the shortest length.</p>

<p>You need to output the sentence after the replacement.</p>

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: dict = ["cat", "bat", "rat"]
sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>The input will only have lower-case letters.
